# hey.

so, i like to dump my thoughts somewhere.

i've been doing it by myself in notion. it really gives me a sense of satisfaction, clarity and provides closure for me on a certain matter.

now, i'm going to doing it publicly. yeah, i'm basically taking a dumb in public, if you think about it. part of the reason is that i'll prolly put more thought into it before yapping, if I do it in public. yk, people like to shit on people doing mistakes.

i'm not cocky enough to think that whatever i say is gospel, or you should listen to me. but i'm doing this to know more about myself (🤮), and to get better at writing.

follow me on twitter [@jassdotgg](https://x.com/jassdotgg). will prolly post whenever there's a new blog.

thanks fo yo time yo.
